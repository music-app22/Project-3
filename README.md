# Playsongify

## Description

Playing and rating our favorite songs is simple and easy. Listening and rating a 30s random song clip isdifferent. Playsongify will give you a random song from Spotify. If you (the user) liked the song that was played, then you are able to save the song to the table and give it a rating out of 5 Stars. Let's give it a try shall we?
